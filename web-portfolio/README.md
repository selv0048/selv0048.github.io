I created the mock up in our user experience class.  Honestly this was one of the hardest assignments we have had to date.  There were many challenges to face because we had creative control over everything.  That added more pressure to the work than usual.  I like to follow visuals that have already been created and layed out and then I can go ahead and try and make something similar.  Having to create the mockup and then design the site added more stress than usual because it's your design. 

I tried out many different colour palettes using coolors and then tried to go with cool but fresh colours.  That was one of the harder things to do since I like having multiple colours in my websites.  The next challenge was trying to find images that fit with the theme and style of my website.  Using my own work helped quite a bit because I am able to show off my work as well not have to rely one someone else's images.  Working with your images comes with a whole set of problems, such as sizing and displaying them properly.

The challenge to not want to pull out your hair or redesign something every time something doesn't work was overwhelming at times.  I guess that is a part of the job.  I want to learn more and be able to do more with this.  Although I may stress and moan over coding I can't say I don't love it. Doing this final made me realize how hard the path I am taking is but I know it will be workth it in the end.
