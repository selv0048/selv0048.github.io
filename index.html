                <p>I didn't do anything special over the break.
                I just stayed home and got caught up on my reading and Netflix tv shows.  I watched After Life starring Ricky Gervais.
                Also I tried to do some course review from last semester.  I have been trying
                to stay indoors as much as possible, but it's very hard.
